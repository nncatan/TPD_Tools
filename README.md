# TPD_Tools
TPD_Tools is a 2D lighting toolset for the Foundry's Nuke.

This toolset was developed during the production of SCAD Animation Studios' *The Pope's Dog* (2021), to recreate the hand-crafted lighting approach pioneered by SPA Studio's *Klaus* (2019).

### INSTALLATION

Drag the *init.py* script and the *TPD_Tools* folder into your .nuke folder.  

If you already have an *init.py*, add this to it:

> nuke.pluginAddPath('./TPD_Tools')
